*Assignment 7: Legibility, Readability, and Typography*



## Assignment 2 details

Link to Assignment 2 website: [Copenhagen](https://amanshrestha.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment02/index.html)

Typeface used: [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces?preview.text_type=custom)



## New typefaces choices and why?

The new typefaces I used were [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?preview.text_type=custom) for the headings and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text_type=custom) for the paragrahs. 

### Playfair Display

As a transisitonal typeface, Playfair Display offered the perfect amount of a traditonal but modern feel. These two adjectives explain how the city of Copenhagen opperates, at least according to the content on the webpage. Plus the two pictures used in the title section show a more traditonal-looking building and a modern one as well so it fits with the feeling of the typeface.

### Open Sans

I chose Open Sans because it is a humanist typeface. The webpage claims that Copenhagen is the world's happiest city to live in so I felt choosing a typeface that gives a more empathetic feeling would be the best to match this claim.



## Changes to improve legibility and readability

* Removed test shadows from headings - the addition of the shadows decreased the readbility of the headings even though the headings were legible.
* "About the City" heading no longer overlaps with the picture - the area of the picture the heading text was overlapping with was too dark to read what the heading said, since the heading was also a dark color. I could have made the heading a lighter color (e.g. white) to create more of a contrast with the image but then I had to change all the headings to be that color to maintain consistency. Moving the heading down so it did not overlap with the picture seemed like the simplest option.
* Made the gradient of the title text darker - improves readibility because there is a better contrast with the text and its backgrounds.
* Increased line height to the standard 1.75em - improve readibilty to have that elbow room between lines of text in a paragragh.
* Decreased the spacing between the headings and its corresponsding paragraphs to explicity show that they are with each other.
* Decreased the max width of the main content of the webpage - text that stretches accross the width of the webpage makes it hard to read.
